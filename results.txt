Camera portion:

My Camera worked by finding the amount of red in a line, and also the amount of blue in the entire image. Images with high amount of blue came from a shade,
and so I had to lower the threshold for the detection of red.

Sliders:

My sliders calibrated the thresholds for red and blue color in the image.

What I sent to the PIC:

I calculated two COMs in the image, and then found the angle of the line based on this
information. To the PIC I sent this angle value. Based on this information I turned y
my servo. My driving motors were full on to full throttle the whole time.
